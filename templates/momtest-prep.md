## Mindset Preparation

### Rules to Remember

**Rule 1: Talk about their life, not your idea**

- [ ] I will let them do 70%+ of talking
- [ ] I will ask about THEIR experiences
- [ ] I will NOT mention my solution (yet)

**Rule 2: Ask about specifics in the past**

- [ ] I will ask "Tell me about the last time..."
- [ ] I will avoid "Would you..." and "Do you think..."
- [ ] I will probe for real examples

**Rule 3: Talk less, listen more**

- [ ] I will NOT explain my idea upfront
- [ ] I will use follow-up questions
- [ ] I will embrace awkward silence

### Mental Preparation

**I am here to:**

- [ ] Listen and learn
- [ ] Understand their world
- [ ] Discover real problems
- [ ] Collect evidence

**I am NOT here to:**

- [ ] Sell or pitch
- [ ] Validate my assumptions
- [ ] Get compliments
- [ ] Make them like my idea

**Mantra:** _"Criticism is a gift. I might be wrong, and that's okay."_

---

## Opening Script

> "I'm trying to learn more about how people discover new wines. Can I ask you a few questions about your experience?"

**NOT:**

> ~~"I'm building a wine startup and would love your feedback."~~

**Practice saying opening 3 times:**

1. ***
2. ***
3. ***

**Red Flag Check:** ☐ Opening focuses on THEM, not ME

---

## Follow-Up Question Arsenal

### The 5 Whys

- "Why is that important to you?"
- "Why does it work/not work that way?"
- "Why didn't you [do alternative]?"
- "Why did you choose [X over Y]?"
- "Why now?"

### Specificity Probes

- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "When exactly did this happen?"
- "How much did that cost you?"
- "How long did that take?"
- "What did you do next?"

### Budget Reality Checks

- "What do you currently spend on [category]?"
- "What have you bought to try to solve this?"
- "What would you stop paying for to pay for this instead?"

**Practice responding to vague answers:**

Them: _"I like trying new wines."_

Me: _"Tell me about the last time you tried a new wine."_

---

## Warning Sign Awareness

### Compliment Flags

If they say:

- "That's a great idea!"
- "You're going to be rich!"
- "I wish this existed!"

**Response:** _"Thank you! Can you tell me about a time you tried to solve this yourself?"_

### Hypothetical Flags

If they say:

- "I would probably..."
- "I might..."
- "I think I would..."

**Response:** _"Have you done that before? Tell me about the last time."_

### Deflection Flags

If they say:

- "You should talk to my friend!"
- "This is perfect for [someone else]!"

**Response:** _"Thanks! Before I do, I'm curious - why them and not you?"_
