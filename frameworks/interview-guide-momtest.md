# The Mom Test Interview Guide

**VINO12 - Customer Validation Framework**

---

## Overview

**Doel:** Get honest, actionable feedback by asking about past behavior instead of future hypotheticals.

**Core Principle:** "Talk about their life instead of your idea"

**Duration:** 30-45 minuten per conversation

**Methodologie:** The Mom Test (Rob Fitzpatrick) - vraag vragen die zelfs je moeder niet kan liegen over.

---

## The 3 Rules of The Mom Test

### Rule 1: Talk about their life, not your idea

**❌ BAD:**

> "Would you use a wine subscription service that sends you personalized selections?"

**✅ GOOD:**

> "Tell me about the last time you bought wine for yourself."

**Why:** Future hypotheticals are lies. Past behavior is truth.

---

### Rule 2: Ask about specifics in the past, not generics or opinions about the future

**❌ BAD:**

> "Do you think you would pay €25/month for curated wine?"

**✅ GOOD:**

> "What's the most you've ever spent on a bottle of wine? What made you spend that much?"

**Why:** People are terrible at predicting their own behavior. Historical data is gold.

---

### Rule 3: Talk less, listen more

**❌ BAD:**

> "So we're building this platform that uses AI to match you with wines based on your taste profile, kind of like Spotify but for wine, and..."

**✅ GOOD:**

> "Hmm, interesting. Tell me more about that."

**Why:** If you're talking, you're not learning. Your job is to listen and probe.

---

## The Conversation Structure

### Phase 1: Their World (No Mention of Your Idea)

**Goal:** Understand their current reality without biasing them

#### Opening

> **"I'm trying to learn more about how people discover new wines. Can I ask you a few questions about your experience?"**

(Not: "I'm building a wine startup...")

#### Current Behavior

**Ask:**

- "Walk me through how you currently find new wines to try"
- "When was the last time you tried a new wine?"
- "What prompted you to try it?"
- "How did that go?"

**Listen for:**

- Frequency of behavior (do they actually do this?)
- Pain intensity (how frustrated are they?)
- Workarounds (what do they do now to solve this?)
- Budget allocation (do they spend money on this?)

---

### Phase 2: The Problem (Still No Mention of Solution)

**Goal:** Validate the problem exists and is painful

#### Pain Discovery

**Good Questions:**

- "What's the hardest part about finding wines you like?"
- "Tell me about a time that went wrong"
- "What do you do when you buy a wine and it's disappointing?"
- "How much time do you spend researching wines before buying?"

**Bad Questions:**

- "Would it be helpful if..." (implies solution)
- "Don't you think it's frustrating that..." (leading)
- "Wouldn't you love to..." (fantasy)

#### The "So What" Test

For every pain point, ask:

- "How much does that cost you?" (time/money/stress)
- "What have you tried to solve this?"
- "Why didn't that work?"

**Red Flag:** If they haven't tried to solve it themselves, the problem isn't that painful.

---

### Phase 3: Budget Reality Check

**Goal:** Understand if they actually spend money on this problem

#### Current Spend

**Ask:**

- "How much do you spend on wine per month?"
- "Do you subscribe to anything wine-related? (Vivino Premium, etc.)"
- "What's the last thing you bought to help with wine selection?"

**Listen for:**

- Are they already spending money in this category?
- What's their reference point for value?
- What do they stop spending on when money is tight?

#### Willingness to Pay (Indirectly)

**Good Approach:**

> "I've heard some people pay for wine tasting events or courses to learn more. Have you ever done that?"

(Then follow up: "What made it worth the cost?" or "Why not?")

**Bad Approach:**

> "Would you pay €25/month for this?"

---

### Phase 4: Validation (Very Carefully)

**Goal:** Test if your solution would actually work, without pitching

#### The Soft Intro

Only AFTER understanding their world:

> "I'm exploring the idea of [1-sentence description]. Based on what you told me, do you think that would have helped in [specific situation they mentioned]?"

**Example:**

> "I'm exploring a service that sends 3 personalized wine recommendations each month. Last time when you [specific pain they mentioned], would that have been useful?"

#### Listen For:

**Strong Signal (Good):**

- "Oh my god, yes! Where do I sign up?"
- "That would have saved me [specific time/money]"
- "I've been looking for exactly that"
- "Can you tell me more? When can I get it?"

**Weak Signal (Bad):**

- "That's interesting..."
- "I might use that"
- "That's a cool idea"
- "You should talk to my friend, they would love this"

#### The Commitment Test

If they seem interested:

**Ask:**

> "Would you be willing to try it when it's ready? Can I email you?"

**Strong Yes:**

- They give email immediately
- They ask follow-up questions
- They want to know timeline

**Polite No (disguised as yes):**

- "Yeah sure, just... how do I find you again?"
- "I don't check that email much"
- Changes subject

## Question Arsenal

### Discovery Questions

**About Past Behavior:**

- "Tell me about the last time you [did X]"
- "Walk me through how you currently [solve Y]"
- "What's the hardest part about [Z]?"

**About Pain:**

- "Can you give me an example?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What did you do next?"

**About Budget:**

- "What do you currently spend on [category]?"
- "What have you bought to try to solve this?"
- "If you had a budget of €X for [solution], what would you want it to do?"

### Follow-Up Questions

**The 5 Whys:**

- Why is that important to you?
- Why does it work/not work that way?
- Why didn't you [do alternative]?
- Why did you choose [X over Y]?
- Why now? (timing)

**Specificity Probes:**

- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "When exactly did this happen?"
- "How much did that cost you?"
- "How long did that take?"

### Validation Questions

**After Understanding Their World:**

- "Based on what you told me, would [solution] have helped?"
- "If [solution] existed, how would you use it?"
- "What would make you stop using [current solution] and switch?"

**Commitment Asks:**

- "Would you pay [€X] for that?"
- "Would you give me your email to be notified?"
- "Would you be willing to be a beta tester?"

---

## Warning Signs

### False Positives (People Being Nice)

**They say:**

- "That's a great idea!"
- "I would definitely use that"
- "You should definitely build this"

**Translation:**

- "I want to be supportive"
- "I don't want to hurt your feelings"
- "This conversation is uncomfortable, let me be nice"

**Test it:**

- Ask for commitment (email, pre-order, beta access)
- Ask about similar products they've tried
- Ask what they'd pay

---

### Compliment Flags

**Red Flag Phrases:**

- "This is genius!"
- "I wish this existed!"
- "You're going to be rich!"

**Why It's Bad:**

- Compliments are not data
- You're probably leading them
- They're being polite, not honest

**Fix:**

- Deflect compliments
- Return to their life/problems
- Ask for specifics

---

### Hypothetical Flags

**Red Flag Phrases:**

- "I would probably..."
- "I might..."
- "I think I would..."

**Why It's Bad:**

- Future tense = fantasy
- Hypotheticals = guessing
- Not based on real behavior

**Fix:**

- "Tell me about a time you actually did that"
- "What's the closest thing you've tried?"
- "Have you looked for something like this before?"

---

## The Mom Test Checklist

### Before the Conversation

**Planning:**

- [ ] Know what you're trying to learn (not validate)
- [ ] Have 3-5 specific questions prepared
- [ ] No pitch deck, no demo (yet)

**Mindset:**

- [ ] You're here to listen, not sell
- [ ] Criticism is a gift
- [ ] You might be wrong (and that's okay)

---

### During the Conversation

**Good Signs:**

- [ ] They're doing most of the talking (70%+)
- [ ] You're asking follow-up questions, not pitching
- [ ] They share specific past examples
- [ ] They complain about current solutions
- [ ] They've already spent money trying to solve this

**Bad Signs:**

- [ ] You're doing most of the talking
- [ ] They're complimenting your idea
- [ ] Everything is hypothetical ("I would probably...")
- [ ] They haven't tried to solve this themselves
- [ ] They're sending you to talk to others

---

### After the Conversation

**Capture:**

- [ ] Specific quotes (word-for-word)
- [ ] Past behaviors (not future intentions)
- [ ] Current spend/budget
- [ ] Pain intensity (how much do they care?)
- [ ] Commitment level (email given? beta interest?)

**Evaluate:**

- [ ] Did they show real pain?
- [ ] Do they currently spend money on this?
- [ ] Did they commit to something?
- [ ] Was this mostly compliments or actual insights?

---

## Advanced Tactics

### The "Feature Request" Trap

**They say:**

> "It would be cool if it could also [feature X, Y, Z]"

**Response:**

> "Interesting! Have you ever tried to do that before? How did it go?"

**Why:** Feature requests are often fantasies. Test if they actually need it by asking if they've ever tried.

---

### The "I'd Pay For That" Trap

**They say:**

> "Yeah, I'd pay €25/month for that"

**Response:**

> "That's helpful! What are you currently paying €25/month for that you'd stop to pay for this instead?"

**Why:** Money is finite. If they can't name what they'd cut, they won't actually pay.

---

### The "Refer Me" Trap

**They say:**

> "Oh, you should talk to my friend Sarah, she would love this!"

**Why It's Bad:**

- They're deflecting
- They're not interested themselves
- They're being polite

**Response:**

> "That's kind, thank you! Before I do, I'm curious - why do you think Sarah would be interested but not you?"

## Sample Conversation Script

### Good Interview Example

**You:** "I'm learning about how people discover new wines. Can you tell me about the last time you tried a wine you'd never had before?"

**Them:** "Oh yeah, last weekend actually. I was at a dinner party and the host had this Italian red..."

**You:** "What made you remember that one specifically?"

**Them:** "It was really good, and I wanted to find it again but I couldn't remember the name."

**You:** "Have you tried to find a wine again like that before?"

**Them:** "Yeah, all the time actually. It's so frustrating. I'll have something great at a restaurant and then never find it again."

**You:** "What have you tried to solve that?"

**Them:** "I started taking photos of labels, but then I forget why I liked it. Was it the wine, or was it just the moment?"

**You:** "What else have you tried?"

**Them:** "I asked the sommeliers for recommendations, but it's hit or miss. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's not my taste at all."

**You:** "When it's not your taste, what do you do?"

**Them:** "Nothing really. I'm out €30 and I feel stupid."

**You:** "How often does that happen?"

**Them:** "Maybe 1 in 3 times? It's expensive to experiment."

**You:** _(Only now mentioning idea)_ "I'm exploring a service that sends personalized wine recommendations each month. Based on what you just told me, would that have helped avoid those mismatches?"

**Them:** "Actually yes! Wait, how does it know my taste?"

_(They're engaged, asking questions - good sign)_

**You:** "Would you be willing to try it when we launch? Can I get your email?"

**Them:** _(Gives email immediately)_ "Yeah absolutely. When is it launching?"

_(Strong commitment - real interest)_

---

### Bad Interview Example

**You:** "I'm building a wine discovery platform using AI to match people with wines. What do you think?"

_(Already pitching - bad start)_

**Them:** "Oh that's cool! That's a great idea!"

_(Compliment flag - not data)_

**You:** "Would you use something like that?"

_(Hypothetical - bad question)_

**Them:** "Yeah I think I would probably use that"

_(Hypothetical answer - not real commitment)_

**You:** "Would you pay €25/month for it?"

_(Testing price without context - bad)_

**Them:** "Hmm, maybe? That seems reasonable"

_(Non-committal - polite no)_

**You:** "Great! I'll let you know when we launch"

**Them:** "Yeah definitely, how do I find you again?"

_(Deflection - they don't actually want to hear from you)_

---

**Result:** No real insights, false validation, wasted time.
